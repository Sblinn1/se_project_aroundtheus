# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview  

Project 3, Around The U.S, is a webpage with a few different sections. We have a header, a profile, a cards section, and a footer. The header has the title image, the profile has our explorer, the cards have the photos of the different places around the U.S, and the footer has our copyright. 
  
**Intro**
  
This project tested my ability to be able to make a webpage responsive. This means that the webpage will look differently across different screensizes. I was able to make a layout for a larger desktop window, a tablet size, and a phone size. So, the layout of the website on a phone screen looks much different then it does on my laptop screen. To be able to achieve this, I had to use media queries. Media queries allow you to apply different properties to certain elements at different resolutions.

**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 
  
Good luck and have fun!
